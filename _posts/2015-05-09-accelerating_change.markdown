title: Accelerating change
---

> **Accelerating change** is a positive feedback effect influencing the speed of the overall system's dynamics. As more information is fed to agents they produce more events in response, which produces in turn even more information for other agents. However, the overall capacity to process information relevantly is limited. Accelerated change amplifies fragility because at the level of the sociotechnological system, once the pace of events exceeds the capacity of the system to process information, the system becomes “blind” and more exposed to unpredictable adverse events.
