title: cognitive development explained (a little bit)
---

The theory of cognitive development was developed largely in late sixties-early seventies in the context of child development[^1],[^2].

Later in eighties expanded to cover the whole life of an individual [^3].

We generalize the framework to explain the development of living cognitive systems in general (i.e. humans, societies, artificial intelligences ...)[^4].
