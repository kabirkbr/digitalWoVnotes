title: hyper-connectivity

> **Hyper-connectivity** is a major symptom of progress, resulting in our world becoming progressively more connected at many levels: starting from global transportation networks that deliver goods and people across the planet and culminating in global communication networks, that mobilize and distribute information at an ever increasing volume and speed. A hyper-connected world is a world where every agent is connected by numerous means to many other agents and where distances, both in space and time, are collapsing. The effect of collapsing distances is that local perturbations may swiftly spread and become global perturbations. This means that highly unpredictable and initially unnoticed local events may yield global impacts within very short time spans. Local outbreaks of diseases are hardly contained and may spread via the global transportation system and become pandemics. Computer viruses can spread and disrupt vast portions of the Internet with estimated damages of many millions of dollars. A thoughtless rumor can initiate a chain reaction that may crash international financial markets. These are only a few examples of how hyper-connectivity amplifies fragility. It is almost inconceivable for the global system to protect itself from all these local, potentially disruptive perturbations. Nevertheless, the tendency of the current sociotechnological system will be to limit the freedom of its components and to guide them into more predictable patterns of behavior. Such systemic response will only increase its fragility in the long term.[^1]
