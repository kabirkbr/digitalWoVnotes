title: is the universe a friendly place?
---

This quote of Albert Eistein is mentioned in many places, but the most serious (and probably the first for me) was the mention of it in Robert Dilts' book "Strategies of Genius Volume Two: Albert Einstein". I give the full quote of the page in the book:

> There is, in fact, an anecdote about Einstein that addresses some of these questions. It describes how Einstein was once approached by a reporter during an interview and asked something to the effect of, "Dr. Einstein, you are recognized around the world as one of the most bone fide geniuses of our century, maybe of human history. Your scope of thinking has covered the workings of the universe from the tiny atom to the cosmos. You have seen your discoveries both evolve and enrich, and also mutilate and destroy the human life you so highly value. What, in your opinion is the most important question facing humanity today?"

>Characteristically, Einstein stared off into space for a moment, and then looked down at the ground in front of him. Finally he looked back at the reporter and replied, *"I think the most important question facing humanity is, 'Is the universe a friendly place?' This is the first and most basic question all people must answer for themselves. For if we decide that the universe is an unfriendly place, then we will use our technology, our scientific discoveries and our natural resources to achieve safety and power by creating bigger walls to keep out the unfriendliness and bigger weapons to destroy all that which is unfriendly - and I believe that we are getting to a place where technology is powerful enough that we may either completely isolate or destroy ourselves as well in this process.

> "If we decide that the universe is neither friendly nor unfriendly and that God is essentially 'playing dice with the universe,' then we are simply victims to the random toss of the dice and our lives have no real purpose or meaning.

> "But if we decide that the universe is a friendly place, then we will use our technology, our scientific discoveries and our natural resources to create tools and models for understanding that universe. Because power and safety will come through understanding its workings and its motives."* [^1]

For me this quote illuminates the futility of the 'opposition' between naturalistic and constructivist philosophy in social sciences as both are only partial perspectives. On the other hand, the idea of 'collective social constructivism' does not allow us to shield ourselves from the responsibility, even if we do not 'control' the future.
