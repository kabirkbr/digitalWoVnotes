title: assemblage theory and cognitive development
---

Assemblage theory was introduced by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in [^1] and further modified and developed by Manuel DeLanda in [^2]. Our usage of the theory and its concepts is motivated by a few reasons:

* First, assemblage theory is related to the philosophy of individuation which is a conceptual glue and inspiration of our thinking. At its original level of abstraction, assemblage theory could be seen as a direction towards formulating mechanisms of the process of *becoming*, i.e. emergence of objects, systems and sub-systems.

* Second, Manual DeLanda developed the theory as a philosophical framework explaining the  emergence of scalable social entities such as personal networks, social organizations, markets, cities, nation states etc. The general premises and concepts offered by it are broadly applicable to the study of coalitions of cognitive agents and living systems, especially in the cases of hybrid populations of human and non-human agents [^3]. As it will become clear later, we view any entity that can be assigned with certain degree of autonomy, intentionality and identity as a cognitive agent. We maintain that such a view, partially inspired by Latour [^4], is reasoned and informative with respect to the global information society, especially considering its future developments in the short and medium-term [^5].

The relation of assemblage theory and cognitive development primarily lies in the conceptual understanding of the process of individuation / becoming / development as the interaction among integrating and disintegrating forces. In assemblage theory these forces are referred to as processes of *territorialization* and *deterritorialization*. As DeLanda formulates:

> One and the same assemblage can have components working to stabilize its identity as well as components forcing it to change or even transforming it into a different assemblage. In fact one and the same component may participate in both processes by exercising different sets of capacities. [^1]

The theory of cognitive development posits identifiable patterns of human cognitive development which are being described as developmental *stages* [^6] or *truces* [^7]. Cognitive development theories generally describe recursive subject and object relationships when the subject of previous stage becomes an object in the next stage,
sometimes referred to as an ‘evolution of meaning’ [^8]. The process is not linear, but rather is manifested through integration and disintegration sequences of cognitive structures.

Furthermore, assemblage theory builds on the distinction of exterior / interior relations (explained in further slides and an [accompanying comment]({% post_url 2015-05-02-interiority_and_exteriority %})) which connect to the distinction of object / subject in cognitive development theory.
