title: relations of interiority and exteriority
---

There are two interpretations of the interiority-exteriority distinction. They approach the interiority and exteriority from very different position but are often used interchangeably.

* The first interpretation sees relations of interiority as something inherent that define the identity of the sub-system in question (i.e. *logically necessary*) and the relations of exteriority as emergent during co-evolution with other subsystems (i.e. *contingently obligatory*)[^1].

* The second interpretation can be seen as a 'topological simplification' of the first  - the relations of interiority are 'inside' the analyzed system and the relations of exteriority are 'outside'. For example, organs and relations among them are internal to the organism in a sense, that these relations do not cross the boundary of the organism (except in case of organ transplantation).

Simondon [^2] and Merleau-Ponty [^3] maintain that interiority and exteriority form a continuum rather than dichotomy. From the developmental perspective the distinction between relations of interiority and exteriority are fluid:

> Already at the level of physical beings, [..] interiority and exteriority are not substantially different; there are not two domains, but a relative distinction; because, insofar as any indiÂ­vidual is capable of growth, what was exterior to it can become interior [^2].
