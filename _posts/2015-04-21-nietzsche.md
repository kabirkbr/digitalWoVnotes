title: thou hast made danger thy calling

The image of the rope walker and with beauty and 'occupational hazards' of the activity is obviously taken from the Prologue of Friedrich Nietzsche's ["Thus Spake Zarathustra"](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Thus_Spake_Zarathustra/Prologue).

There are books written about this image, but most importantly for us it reveals what can be called "the virtual space of the transindividual" which is largely hidden from the plain sight (see G. Simondon; G. Deleuze for more). The meeting of Zarathustra and tight rope walker symbolizes the "encounter between the individual and [hidden] transindividual reality":

> In reality, the interindividual connections are defined less by the constituted individuals (their formed selves, their social functions) or by the socially instituted group (the ensemble of exchanges between individuals), than by the element of preindividual nature which persists, not yet effectuated in them. [^1]

We take two insights from this "revelation".
 
* **First**, objects and even relationships among them within the larger system cannot be referred as *a priori* existing phenomena if one is concerned with the question of how the system develops and changes rather than 'what it is'. 

* **Second**, therefore, it invites us to adopt a 'process view' to the social systems which attempts to see objects and their relationships as intermediate results of ever-ongoing process of change (development, growth, evolution, revolution..., disintegration). 

But even this is not really enough, as one may observe, because any process describing the system dynamics is shaped and influenced by the intermediate states of the system (i.e. previously understated objects and their relationships). We will later gently introduce the concept of *transduction* developed by Simondon as a part of his theory of individuation, which describes reflexive relationships among structure and operation [^2],[^3].
