title: "'classical' metastability"
---

In physics, the definition of metastability is:

>the phenomenon when an **isolated** system spends an extended time in a configuration other than the system's state of least energy. [^1]

While it is much more to the 'classical' definition of metastability that this short definition, in general the concept of metastability is used to describe a far from equilibrium complex system in terms of it's movement in a state-space. A metastable system can be seen as having a state-space with many basins of attraction; most of the time it is 'being stuck' in 'shallow' attractors which may or may not be the state of least energy (actually the notion of the state of the least energy, or global optimum, is not *that* important for the description of a metastable system); the system can be easily perturbed in which case it moves over the border of one basin of attraction to another, as shown in picture below.

A classical example of a metastable state of the system is water at 0 &deg;C. If water is still it stays in liquid state (even below the temperature of 0 &deg;C), but if it is perturbed by vibration, it falls into the state of ice.
