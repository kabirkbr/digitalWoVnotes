title: progressive determination of structure and operation
---
In [^1] we describe this aspect of transduction as follows:

> Perhaps the most important aspect revealed in transduction is the progressive co-determination of structure and function (see also above regarding the notion of metastability). Individuation can be seen as a chain of operations \\(O\\) on structures \\(S\\): \\(S \rightarrow O \rightarrow S \rightarrow O \rightarrow S...\\) [^2]. Every operation is a conversion of one structure into another, while every structure mediates between one operation and another. Each structure in the chain constrains the operations that can immediately follow. Each operation can transform the previous structure into a limited number of new structures. Every intermediate structure is a partial resolution of incompatibility but it is driven away from its relative stability as long as the existing tensions are not exhausted. This is reminiscent of the propagation of a computation in evolutionary programming. Executed code and the data are analogous to operation and structure. But the code itself is also data that can be progressively modified to produce inexhaustible variety and innovation. This analogy helps us understand how operation and structure are reciprocally determining expressions of the transductive process.

Another attempt to formalize the progressive determination, which also grasps the concept of metastability proposed in the previous slide, is due to Marsh and Onof. They propose the modified Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) where the global fitness function \\(f\_t\\) is defined as **dependent** on the actual configuration of particles at time \\(t\\) within the state space:

> [..] this would amount to having the moves made by the individuals (either each individual’s trajectory, or perhaps only the evolution of the group’s best position) have an impact upon the actual shape of the landscape – one could imagine these individuals’ movements causing earthquakes or landslides, for instance [^3].
